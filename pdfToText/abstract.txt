This raises the question of how well we can approximate the Fréchet distance (of two given d—dimensional point sequences of length n) in strongly subquadratic time. Previously, no general results were known. We present the first such algorithm by analysing the approximation ratio of a simple, linear-time greedy algorithm to be 2901). Moreover, we design an a-approximation algorithm that runs in time 0(n10gn + 712/01), for any a 6 [1,71]. Hence, an nE-approximation of the Fréchet distance can be computed in strongly subquadratic time,  for any 5 > 0.
