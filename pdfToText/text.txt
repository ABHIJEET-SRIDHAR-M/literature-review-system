This is because game based education pro-\nvides an opportunity for learning in a natural environment. Phishing is an online identity theft, which\nattempts to steal sensitive information such as username, password, and online banking details from\nits victims. To prevent this, phishing awareness needs to be considered. This research aims to develop\na game design framework, which enhances user avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect users\nfrom phishing attacks. In order to do this, a theoretical model derived from Technology Thread Avoidance\nTheory (TTAT) was developed and used in the game design framework (Liang & Xue, 2010). A survey\nstudy was undertaken with 150 regular computer users to elicit feedback through a questionnaire. The\nstudy findings revealed that perceived threat, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost, self-efficacy, per-\nceived severity, and perceived susceptibility elements should be addressed in the game design frame-\nwork for computer users to avoid phishing attacks. Furthermore, we argue that this game design\nframework can be used not only for preventing phishing attacks but also for preventing other malicious\nIT attacks such as viruses, malware, botnets and spyware.\n\n\xef\xbf\xbd 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nSecurity exploits can include malicious IT threats such as com-\nputer programs which can disturb the normal behaviour of com-\nputer systems (viruses), malicious software (malware),\nunsolicited e-mail (spam), monitoring software (spyware),\nattempting to make computer resources unavailable to its in-\ntended users (Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS attack), the\nart of human hacking (social engineering) and online identity theft\n(phishing). These attacks are prepared to target either financial\nor social gain (Purkait, 2012; Aggarwaly, Rajadesingan, &\nKumaraguru, 2012; Ng, Kankanhalli, & Xu, 2009; Workman,\nBommer, & Straub, 2008 and Woon, Tan, & Low, 2005). For exam-\nple, a DDoS attack could target a bank in order to break down their\ne-mail server and the attacker can exhort a lump sum of money to\ngive the e-mail server back to the bank.\n\nOne such IT threat that is particularly dangerous to computer\nusers is phishing. This is a type of semantic attack (Purkait, 2012;\nAggarwaly et al., 2012; Downs, Holbrook, & Cranor, 2007 and\nSchneier, 2000) in which attackers try to fool and steal money from\nlegitimate Internet users sending e-mails rather than exploiting\nbugs in computer software. The attacker creates a fraudulent\nweb site which has the look-and-feel of the legitimate website.\nThen users are invited by sending e-mails to access to a fraudulent\nwebsite and steal their money. Phishing attacks get more sophisti-\ncated regularly as and when attackers learn new techniques and\nchange their strategies accordingly (Purkait, 2012; Aggarwaly\net al., 2012 and Kumaraguru et al., 2007). The most popular\napproach is e-mail (James, 2005 and Richmond, 2006). Phishing\ne-mails employ a variety of tactics to trick people into disclosing\ntheir confidential information such as usernames, passwords, na-\ntional insurance numbers and credit/debit card numbers. For\nexample, asking people to take part in a survey or urging people\nto verify their bank account information in which they must pro-\nvide their bank details to be compensated. The increasing sophisti-\ncation of these techniques makes it a challenge to protect\nindividual users against phishing attacks (Purkait, 2012 and Drake,\nOliver, & Koontz, 2006).\n\nPersonal computer users are susceptible to phishing attacks due\nto the rapid growth of internet technology (Purkait, 2012; Aggarw-\naly et al., 2012 and Ponnurangam et al., 2007). This is because users\ncan have lack of security awareness and sensitive trust decisions\nthat they make during online activities such as online banking\ntransactions or bill payments. Therefore, personal computer users\nmake a significant contribution in helping to make cyberspace a\nsafer place for everyone. Internet technology is so ubiquitous today\nthat it provides the backbone for modern living enabling ordinary\npeople to socialize, shop, and be entertained all through their per-\nsonal computers. As people\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Internet grows, the possi-\nbility of hacking, attacking and other security breaches increases\nrapidly (Liang & Xue, 2009). Therefore, the message \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98security is\nimportant\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 should be reached to all personal computer users.\n\nhttp://crossmark.dyndns.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.018&domain=pdf\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.018\nmailto:Nalin.Asanka@brunel.ac.uk\nmailto:Steve.

Love / Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 706\xe2\x80\x93714 707\nAutomated computer systems can be used to identify some\nfraudulent e-mails and websites (Sanchez & Duan, 2012; Purkait,\n2012 and Workman et al., 2008). Dhamija and Tygar (2005) and\nYe and Sean (2002) have developed a prototype called \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98trusted\npaths\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 for the Mozilla web browser that was designed to help users\nverify that their browser has made a secure connection to a trusted\nwebsite. Nevertheless, these systems are not totally reliable in\ndetecting phishing attacks (Purkait, 2012; Sanchez & Duan, 2012\nand Sheng et al., 2007). Previous research has revealed that avail-\nable anti-phishing tools such as CallingID Toolbar, Cloudmark\nAnti-Fraud Toolbar, EarthLink Toolbar, Firefox 2, eBay Toolbar\nand Netcraft Anti-Phishing Toolbar are deficient for combating\nphishing threats (Purkait, 2012 and Robila & Ragucci, 2006). Even\nthe best toolbars neglect over 20% of phishing websites (Zhang,\nEgelman, Cranor, & Hong, 2007). On the one hand, software appli-\ncation designers and developers will continue to improve phishing\nand spam detection. However, human is the weakest link in infor-\nmation security (Purkait, 2012 and CNN.com, 2005). On the other\nhand, human factor risks can mitigate by educating users on how\nto combat phishing threats (Purkait, 2012; Aggarwaly et al.,\n2012; Brody, Mulig, & Kimball, 2007 and Robila & Ragucci, 2006).\n\nPhishing education needs to be considered to protect individual\nusers against phishing threats. Previous studies have reported end-\nuser education as a frequently recommended approach to counter-\ning phishing attacks (Allen, 2006; Hiner, 2002; Purkait, 2012;\nTimko, 2008 and Kumaraguru et al., 2007). So, how to educate\ncomputer users to combat phishing threat?\n\nThe design of games is a double-edged sword. When its power\nis properly harnessed to serve good purposes, it has tremendous\npotential to improve human performance. However, when it is\nexploited for violation purposes, it can pose huge threats to indi-\nviduals and society. Therefore, the design of educational games is\nnot an easy task and there are no all-purpose solutions (Walls,\n2012 and Moreno-Ger, Burgos, Sierra, & Fern\xc3\xa1ndez-Manj\xc3\xb3n,\n2008). The notion that game based education offers the opportu-\nnity to embed learning in a natural environment has repeatedly\nemerged in the research literature (Arachchilage & Cole, 2011;\nWalls, 2012; Moreno-Ger et al., 2008 and Sheng et al., 2007).\n\nThis research study is the first step in the development of a\ngame design framework to enhance user avoidance behaviour\nthrough motivation to thwart phishing attacks. The aim of this\nstudy is to investigate what key elements should be addressed in\nthe game design framework to avoid phishing attacks.\n\nThe objectives are as follows:\n\n\xef\xbf\xbd Identify the key elements that should be addressed in the game\ndesign framework to avoid phishing attacks.\n\xef\xbf\xbd Evaluate the game design framework using phishing attack\n\n(malicious IT threat) and game based anti-phishing education\n(safeguarding measure).\n\xef\xbf\xbd Formulate a game design framework to thwart phishing attacks.\n\n2. Theoretical Background\n\nThe premise behind this study is to develop a game design\nframework, which enhances user avoidance behaviour through\nmotivation to protect them against phishing attacks. A theoretical\nmodel derived from Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT)\nwas used to develop the game design framework, which is shown\nin Fig. 1 (Liang & Xue, 2010). The TTAT describes individual IT\nusers\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour of avoiding the threat of malicious information\ntechnologies such as phishing attacks (Liang & Xue, 2009). The\nmodel examines how individuals avoid malicious IT threats by\nusing a given safeguarding measure. The safeguarding measure\ndoes not necessarily have to be an IT source such as anti-phishing\ntools; rather it could be behaviour such as anti-phishing education\n(Liang & Xue, 2010).\n\nConsistent with TTAT (Liang & Xue, 2009), users\xe2\x80\x99 IT threat\navoidance behaviour is determined by avoidance motivation,\nwhich, in turn, is affected by perceived threat. Perceived threat is\ninfluenced by perceived severity and susceptibility. Perceived\nthreat is also influenced by the interaction of perceived severity\nand susceptibility. User\xe2\x80\x99s avoidance motivation is also determined\nby three constructs such as safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost,\nand self-efficacy.\n\nSafeguard effectiveness is described as the individual assess-\nment of a safeguarding measure regarding how effectively it can\nbe applied to avoid the malicious IT threat (Liang & Xue, 2010).\nFor example, the individual assessment regarding how effectively\nanti-phishing education can be applied to avoid a phishing attack.\nSafeguard cost is a payback for safeguard effectiveness. This refers\nto the physical and cognitive efforts such as time, money, inconve-\nnience and comprehension required using the safeguard measure\n(Liang & Xue, 2009). Self-efficacy is defined as individuals\xe2\x80\x99 confi-\ndence in taking the safeguard measure. This is an important deter-\nminant of avoidance motivation. Previous research has revealed\nthat individuals are more motivated to perform IT security related\nbehaviours as the level of their self-efficacy increases (Kaiser, in\npress; Ng et al., 2009; Woon et al., 2005). In addition, the research\nmodel posits that avoidance motivation is influenced by an inter-\naction between perceived threat and safeguard effectiveness.\n\nThe TTAT identifies the issues that the game design framework\nneeds to address. The proposed game design framework attempts\nto develop threat perceptions such that individuals will be more\nmotivated to avoid phishing attacks and use safeguarding mea-\nsures. A key aspect of this is that they realise the effectiveness of\nsafeguarding measures, lower safeguard costs, and increase self-\nefficacy.\n\nSheng et al. have conducted a role-play survey with 1001 online\nsurvey respondents to study who falls for phishing attacks (Sheng,\nHolbrook, Kumaraguru, Cranor, & Downs, 2010). The study re-\nvealed that women are more susceptible than men to phishing\nand participants between the ages of 18 and 25 are more suscepti-\nble to phishing than other age groups. Participants are included\nfrom a diverse group of staff and student, including people who\nwere concerned about computer security. The study described in\nthis paper was targeted towards to examine participants\xe2\x80\x99 phishing\nthreat avoidance behaviour by using anti-phishing education.\nTherefore, the survey was only administered to participants\xe2\x80\x99 ages\nranged from 18 to 25 those who had not already completed the\nquestionnaire before.\n3. Pilot study\n\nA pilot study is a rehearsal, which is conducted before the main\nstudy takes place (Compeau & Higgins, 1995; Milne, Orbell, &\nSheeran, 2002; Sonderegger & Sauer, 2010). It helps the researcher\nto determine whether or not the study is appropriate in terms of\nvalidity. If any problems are encountered during the pilot study,\nadjustments are made before the main study. A quantitative anal-\nysis, based on Likert style questionnaire, approach was adopted to\nevaluate the game design framework described in this paper.\n3.1. Questionnaire design\n\nThe questionnaire was constructed based on Liang and Xue\xe2\x80\x99s\ntheoretical model and relevant research literature (Liang & Xue,\n2009; Liang & Xue, 2010; Rosenstock, 1974; Saleeby, 2000; Smith,\nMilberg, & Burke, 1996; Champion & Scott, 1997; Compeau &\nHiggins, 1995; Davis, 1989 and Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1983).\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Research model derived from TTAT (Liang & Xue, 2010).\n\n708 N.A.G. Arachchilage, S. Love / Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 706\xe2\x80\x93714\nPerceived threat was measured on the basis of substantive mean-\ning (Rosenstock, 1974). The questionnaire items related to this as-\npect assessed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 perception of the likely harm, danger,\nperil or damage that phishing attack imposes. Perceived suscepti-\nbility was developed based on health behaviour research (Saleeby,\n2000); and was used to evaluate the likelihood and possibility of\nthe occurrence of a phishing attack.\n\nTTAT speculates that computer users\xe2\x80\x99 well-being includes two\ndimensions: computer performance and information privacy.\nHowever, Liang and Xue argue that a malicious IT attack could\ndamage both dimensions (Liang & Xue, 2009). Therefore, severity\nperception of computer users should relate to the two dimensions.\nPerceived severity was measured by the number of items based on\nthe privacy literature in IS (Smith, Milberg, & Burke, 1996) and\npractitioner research that report the negative impact of phishing\nattacks (Brody et al., 2007; Dhamija, Tygar, & Hearst, 2006; Downs,\nHolbrook, & Cranor, 2006; Downs et al., 2007; Grinter et al., 2006;\nJagatic, Johnson, Jakobsson, & Menczer, 2007; Miller & Garfinkel,\n2005 and Schneier, 2000). The items developed in their research\nwere based on users\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about both loss of personal and\nconfidential information and degraded computer performance re-\nlated to processing speed, Internet connection, and software\napplications.\n\nThe items of safeguard effectiveness were developed based\non relevant health behaviour research (Downs et al., 2007 and\nSaleeby, 2000). For example, a number of items in this subscale\nwere derived for safeguard cost based on Milne et al. and Saleeby\xe2\x80\x99s\nstudies (Champion & Scott, 1997 and Saleeby, 2000). Self-efficacy\nwas measured with items developed by Compeau and Higgins\n(1995), making minor amendments to adapt it to the anti-phishing\neducation context. The number of items developed for avoidance\nmotivation was based on the behavioural intention measures\nfrom technology adoption research (Davis, 1989 and Compeau &\nHiggins, 1995), with a focus on threat avoidance rather than IT\nadoption. Finally, threat avoidance was measured with three self-\ndeveloped items.\n\nTherefore, the pilot study questionnaire contained four items\nfor perceived threat, four items for perceived severity, three items\nfor perceived susceptibility, four items for safeguard effectiveness,\nthree items for safeguard cost, 6 items for self-efficacy, three items\nfor avoidance motivation, and three items for avoidance behaviour.\nIn total 30 items were evaluated using a five-point scale Likert at\n1 = \xe2\x80\x98Strongly disagree\xe2\x80\x99 and 5 = \xe2\x80\x98Strongly agree\xe2\x80\x99. A sample set of\nquestionnaire is shown in Table 1.\n\n3.2. Participants\n\nA pilot study questionnaire survey was run with sixteen first\nyear undergraduate students from the Department of Information\nSystems and Computing, Brunel University, London. A summary of\nthe demographics of the participants in the pilot study is shown in\nTable 2.\n\n3.3. Procedure\n\nThe pilot study questionnaire survey was conducted in-person.\nFirst participants were asked to read and sign the consent form.\nThen the individual participants were asked whether or not they\nknew what the term \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Phishing Attack\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 means. Those who gave a\npositive response were asked to give a short verbal description to\nconfirm their understanding, whilst negative responders were read\na brief definition of phishing attack and given a short verbal\ndescription. Then participants were asked to complete the ques-\ntionnaire. The individual participant was given 10 min to complete\nthe questionnaire. They were also informed that they could pro-\nvide any comments and feedback on both the content and format\nof the study had just been asked to take part.\n\n3.4. Results\n\nCronbach\xe2\x80\x99s alpha, which is known as a coefficient alpha was\nused to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire\n(Pallant, 2007). Previous research has indicated that an alpha score\nthat is greater than 7.0 indicates that there is a good level of inter-\nnal scale consistency (Cronbach, 1951; Pallant, 2007 and Zaharias\n& Poylymenakou, 2009).Therefore, Cronbach\xe2\x80\x99s alpha was calcu-\nlated for each construct of the questionnaire and is summarised\nin Table 3.\n\n\n\nTable 1\nA sample set of questionnaire.\n\nN.A.G.

Summary\n\nBased on the feedback obtained from the wording of some mea-\nsurement items of each construct was slightly revised. The final\nquestionnaire contained four items for perceived threat, four items\nfor perceived severity, three items for perceived susceptibility, four\nitems for safeguard effectiveness, three items for safeguard cost, 6\nitems for self-efficacy, three items for avoidance motivation, and\nthree items for avoidance behaviour. Therefore, total 30 items were\nused in the main study to measure 8 constructs in the research\nmodel using a five-point scale Likert at 1 = \xe2\x80\x98Strongly disagree\xe2\x80\x99 and\n5 = \xe2\x80\x98Strongly agree\xe2\x80\x99.\n4. Main study\n\n4.1. Participants\n\nThe questionnaire was administrated to 151 participants, who\nwere undergraduate students from Brunel University and Bedford-\nshire University. Participants\xe2\x80\x99 ages ranged from 18 to 25, with a\ngender split of 67% male and 33% female. They had average of\n16\xe2\x80\x9320 h per week of Internet experience (SD = 1.19). Each partici-\npant took part in the survey on a fully voluntary basis. A summary\nof the demographics of the participants in the main study is shown\nin Table 4.\n4.2. Procedure\n\nThe questionnaire was handed out to participants\xe2\x80\x99 in-person by\nthe researcher. First, the nature of the research was explained to\neach participant individually and they were given an informed\nconsent form to read and sign. They were also told that they were\nfree to withdraw from the study at any time without having to give\na reason for withdrawing. Then the individual participants were\nasked whether or not they knew what the term \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Phishing Attack\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nmeans. Those who gave a positive response were asked to give a\nshort verbal description to confirm their understanding, whilst\nnegative respondents were read a brief definition of a phishing at-\ntack and also given a short verbal description. Then participants\nwere asked to complete the questionnaire, which measured the\neight constructs; perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, per-\nceived threat, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost, self-efficacy,\navoidance motivation and avoidance behaviour. The individual\nparticipant was given 10 min to complete the questionnaire. After\ncompleting the questionnaire, participants were thanked for their\nvaluable time and effort in taking part in the study.\n\n4.3. Results\n\nAs in the pilot study, Cronbach\xe2\x80\x99s alpha was calculated for each\nconstruct to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire\nitems. The results of this analysis are summarised in Table 5. Pre-\nvious research has been shown minimum level of Cronbach\xe2\x80\x99s alpha\nis 0.7 to be internally consistent of a set of items as a group (Cronbach,\n1951; Pallant, 2007 and Zaharias & Poylymenakou, 2009).\n\nIn addition, the Kaiser\xe2\x80\x93Meyer\xe2\x80\x93Olkin (KMO) value measure was\nused to assess the adequacy of the sample and the KMO value\nshould be greater than 0.6 for a satisfactory analysis to proceed\n(Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). For the sample used in this study the\nKMO = 0.718.\n\n4.4. Model testing\n\nThe study employed a multiple regression analysis to test the\nLiang and Xue\xe2\x80\x99s theoretical model using the following parameters:\nphishing attack and anti-phishing education as a malicious IT\nthreat and safeguarding measure respectively.\n\nThe model testing results are shown in Fig. 2. The model calcu-\nlated R square value for perceived threat, avoidance motivation,\nand avoidance behaviour, which was defined as how much of var-\niance in the dependent variable is explained by its independent\nvariables in the model (Davis et al., 1983). In the results for the\nmodel in this study 36% of variance is explained in perceived\nthreat, 22% of variance in avoidance motivation, and 15% of\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Model testing results.\n\nFig. 3. The game design framework.\n\nN.A.G. Arachchilage, S. Love / Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 706\xe2\x80\x93714 711\nvariance in avoidance behaviour. Pearson correlation analysis was\nthen employed to describe the strength and direction of the linear\nrelationship between two constructs. The results indicate that per-\nceived threat is significantly determined by perceived severity\n(r = .499\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000) and perceived susceptibility (r = .357\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84,\nand Sig. = .000). Avoidance motivation is significantly determined\nby perceived threat (r = .386\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000). According to Liang\nand Xue\xe2\x80\x99s and Baron and Kenny\xe2\x80\x99s research, these results show that\nthe influences of perceived susceptibility and severity on avoid-\nance motivation are fully mediated by perceived threat.\n\nAs Fig. 2 shows, avoidance motivation is also significantly\ndetermined by safeguard effectiveness (r = .381\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000),\n\n\n\n712 N.A.G. Arachchilage, S. Love / Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 706\xe2\x80\x93714\nself-efficacy (r = .162\xe2\x81\x84, Sig. = .047), and safeguard cost (r = \xef\xbf\xbd.112\xe2\x81\x84,\nSig. = .037). Finally, avoidance motivation is found to be signifi-\ncantly influence by avoidance behaviour (r = .390\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and\nSig. = .000).\n\nTo evaluate the interaction effects of both perceived susceptibil-\nity and severity, and perceived threat and safeguard effectiveness,\nChin et al.\xe2\x80\x99s product-indicator approach was used (Chin, Marcolin,\n& Newsted, 2003). Interaction variables were created by cross mul-\ntiplying the items of perceived susceptibility and severity, and per-\nceived threat and safeguard effectiveness (Liang & Xue, 2010). As\nFig. 2 shows, the interaction between perceived severity and sus-\nceptibility was statistically significant on perceived threat\n(r = .588\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000). Finally, the interaction between per-\nceived threat and safeguard effectiveness was statistically signifi-\ncant on avoidance motivation (r = .452\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000).\n\nIn summary, the model testing results provided support to all of\nthe hypotheses. Moreover, age, gender, and Internet experiences\nwere included as control variables on avoidance motivation and\navoidance behaviour in the model testing. However, none of these\ncontrol variables was found to have a statistically significant effect\non either avoidance motivation or avoidance behaviour. This is\nsimilar to the finding of Liang and Xue\xe2\x80\x99s empirical study.\n5. Game design framework\n\nThis study empirically investigated what key elements should\nbe addressed in the game design framework for computer users\nto avoid phishing attacks through motivation. The elements of a\ntheoretical model derived from TTAT, was used to address in the\ngame design framework. Fig. 2 shows the model testing results.\nThe model accounts for 36% of variance in perceived threat, 21%\nof variance in avoidance motivation, and 15% of variance in avoid-\nance behaviour. Perceived threat is significantly determined by\nperceived severity (r = .499\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000), perceived suscepti-\nbility (r = .357\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000) and their interaction (r = .588\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84,\nand Sig. = .000). Therefore, perceived severity and perceived sus-\nceptibility elements addressed in the game design framework for\ncomputer users to thwart phishing attacks. As Fig. 2 shows, avoid-\nance behaviour is significantly determined by perceived threat\n(r = .386\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000), safeguard effectiveness (r = .381\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and\nSig. = .000), and safeguard cost (r = \xef\xbf\xbd.112\xe2\x81\x84, Sig. = .037), and self-\nefficacy (r = .162\xe2\x81\x84, Sig. = .047). However, it is interesting to note\nthat safeguard cost negatively effects avoidance motivation though\nit is significantly determined by avoidance motivation. This is be-\ncause the user\xe2\x80\x99s motivation to avoid the IT threat is expected be re-\nduced by the potential cost of using the safeguard measure (Liang\n& Xue, 2010). Therefore, perceived threat, safeguard effectiveness,\nsafeguard cost, and self-efficacy elements should be addressed\nin the game design framework. Finally, avoidance motivation is\nfound significantly influence avoidance behaviour (r = .390\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and\nSig. = .000).\n\nIn summary, this study results provided support to determine\nwhat key elements should be addressed in the game design frame-\nwork for computer users to avoid phishing attacks through motiva-\ntion. Therefore, perceived threat, safeguard effectiveness,\nsafeguard cost, self-efficacy, perceived threat, and perceived sus-\nceptibility elements addressed in the game design framework.\nThe game design framework is shown in Fig. 3.\n6. Discussion\n\nThis study empirically investigated a game design framework\nfor computer users to thwart phishing attacks. Therefore, phishing\nattack and anti-phishing education were considered as a malicious\nIT threat and safeguarding measure respectively in order to test a\ntheoretical model derived from TTAT (Liang & Xue, 2010). The\nstudy paid particular attention to threat perception because it\nplays a vital role in influencing computer users\xe2\x80\x99 avoidance behav-\niour. Data analysis results showed in Fig. 2, the model is able to ex-\nplain a considerable amount of variance in users\xe2\x80\x99 motivation to\navoid IT threats (22%) and actual avoidance behaviour (15%).\nTherefore, this study conveys a simple, yet powerful message to\nmotivate computer users to avoid malicious IT threats.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that avoidance behaviour is\nquite low though it is significant (Pallant, 2007). There is a possible\nexplanation for this result. When users decide that the IT threat\ncan be avoided by the safeguarding measures, they may take a\nproblem-focused coping measure. However, when the IT threat\ncould not be avoided completely, they may take an emotion-fo-\ncused coping approach (Liang & Xue, 2010; Liang & Xue, 2009\nand Rhoa & Yub, 2011). Lazarus and Folkman asserted two types\nof coping could be performed to deal with the threat; problem-\nfocused and emotion-focused (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Prob-\nlem-focused coping referred to adaptive behaviors that take a\nproblem-solving approach. It directly deals with the malicious IT\nthreat by taking safeguarding measure such as updating password\nregularly, disabling cookies, and installing and configuring safe-\nguarding IT. When people face the problem as a challenge, they seem\nto take a problem-oriented coping behavior and treat the problem as\na thing that can be controlled. In contrast, emotion-focused coping,\nthe problem identified as a threat and loss, people tend to perceive\nit as a thing cannot be solved by them and hence, take an emotional\ncoping behavior. Beaudry and Pinsonneaut stated that if users per-\nceive the malicious IT threat, they take problem-focused coping, or\nif they believe that the threat is not avoidable, they will inactively\navoid the threat by performing emotion-focused coping (Beaudry &\nPinsonneaut, 2001). Therefore, it can therefore be argued in the cur-\nrent study, that users\xe2\x80\x99 emotion-focused coping behaviour would\nhave caused for avoidance behaviour of phishing threat, which will\naccount for the variance of avoidance behaviour.\n\nComputer users have to be convinced and feel that such mali-\ncious IT threats exist in the cyberspace and are avoidable. The\nstudy found some evidence in the data analysis results that the\nmodel is able to explain a respectable amount of variance in threat\nperception (36%). This figure is little higher than Liang and Xue\xe2\x80\x99s\nempirical study, which is 33% (Liang & Xue, 2010). Therefore, per-\nceived threat element is significantly important to address in the\ngame design framework for computer users to enhance avoidance\nbehaviour through motivation to thwart phishing attacks. Further-\nmore, the study demonstrates threat perception that users need to\nbe aware of likelihood and severity of being attacked by malicious\nIT threat. If users actually perceive the threat, they are more moti-\nvated to avoid it. The safeguarding measure was evaluated from\nthree aspects; taking into account safeguard effectiveness, cost re-\nlated to safeguard measure, and users confident of using the safe-\nguard. If the level of effectiveness of the safeguarding measure is\nhigh then users are more motivated to avoid threats. So, the safe-\nguard effectiveness element is important in the game design\nframework for computer users to thwart phishing threats. Users\xe2\x80\x99\nhigh confidence in taking the safeguard measures influences their\nmotivation to avoid threats. Therefore, self-efficacy should also\nbe included in the game design framework for avoiding threats\nthrough motivation.\n\nWhen the safeguard cost is high, users are less motivated to\navoid threats. Liang and Xue describes when time, money, inconve-\nnience and comprehension needed to use the safeguarding mea-\nsure is high, users are less motivated to avoid threats (Liang &\nXue, 2009; Liang & Xue, 2010). The current study results also dem-\nonstrated safeguard cost negatively affects avoidance motivation.\nTherefore, safeguard cost should address in the game design\nframework, as a payback to safeguarding effectiveness. Liang and\n\n\n\nN.A.G. Arachchilage, S. Love / Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 706\xe2\x80\x93714 713\nXue\xe2\x80\x99s model testing results did not support the interaction be-\ntween perceived severity and susceptibility on perceived threat\n(Liang & Xue, 2010). Surprisingly, this study revealed that per-\nceived threat is significantly determined by the interaction be-\ntween perceived severity and susceptibility (r = .588\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and\nSig. = .000).\n\nMoreover, this study emphasises that avoidance motivation is\nsignificantly determined by the interaction of perceived threat\nand safeguard effectiveness (r = .452\xe2\x81\x84\xe2\x81\x84, and Sig. = .000). This result\ncontradicts with Liang and Xue\xe2\x80\x99s findings regarding the interaction\nbetween perceived threat and safeguard effectiveness on avoid-\nance motivation (Liang & Xue, 2010). However, they suggest the\ninteraction between perceived threat and safeguard effectiveness\ncan be viewed from two perspectives. First, when the threat level\nis high, perceived threat can be viewed to negatively moderate\nthe relationship between safeguard effectiveness and avoidance\nmotivation. Second, when the level of safeguard effectiveness is\nhigh, it can be viewed to negatively moderate the relationship be-\ntween perceived threat and avoidance motivation. Therefore, this\nstudy does not provide evidence to address the interaction of per-\nceived threat and safeguard effectiveness in the game design\nframework.\n\n7. Conclusion and future work\n\nThis study attempted to develop a game design framework,\nwhich enhances computer users\xe2\x80\x99 avoidance behaviour through\nmotivation to prevent themselves from phishing attacks. The study\nempirically investigated what elements should address in the\ngame design framework for computer users to thwart phishing at-\ntacks. A theoretical model derived from TTAT was used to develop\nthe game design framework. To test the model, phishing attack and\nanti-phishing education were considered as a malicious IT threat\nand safeguarding measure respectively.\n\nFinally, the current study results provided support to define\nwhat elements should be included in the game design framework\nfor computer users to thwart phishing attacks. Therefore, per-\nceived threat, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost, self-efficacy,\nperceived severity, and perceived susceptibility elements should\nbe incorporated into the game design framework for computer\nusers to avoid phishing attacks through motivation.\n\nFurthermore, for future research we will attempt to design and\nevaluate a mobile game using MIT App Inventor Emulator as a tool\nto educate computer users against the dangers of phishing attacks.\nThe study will use the game design framework developed on the\nresults from the study reported in this paper.\n\nReferences\n\nAggarwaly, A., Rajadesingan, A., Kumaraguru, P.
